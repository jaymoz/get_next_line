This project involves creating a function that can read a file and retrieve a line of text that ends with a newline character using a file descriptor. Subsequent calls to the function will return the next line in the file. The project also includes managing memory allocation to avoid memory leaks.

The function returns -1 if an error occurred during the process, 0 if there is no more content to read in the file, and 1 if a line of text has been successfully read.
